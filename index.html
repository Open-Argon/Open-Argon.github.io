        <p>Argon is a programming language designed for simplicity and readability. Unlike Python or Go, Argon has a unique syntax that sets it apart. While it may not be the fastest language out there, it prioritizes number accuracy over speed, using rational numbers instead of floats. Argon's focus on readability and accuracy makes it a great choice for scientific and mathematical applications.
